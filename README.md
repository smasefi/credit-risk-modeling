# 💳 Credit Risk Modeling<br>
## 📌 Business Problem

Lending institutions must balance profitability with risk: approving enough loan applications to generate revenue, while minimizing losses from defaults.
The core question is:

This is important work because using these probabilities, we can better understand how to reduce credit losses by screening out high-risk borrowers, price loans effectively and manage risk (in terms of losses).<br>

## 🎯 Project Objective

Given borrower and loan information available at the time of application, the goal is to build a supervised machine learning model that estimates the probability of default.

This model will help inform approval/denial decisions and support better credit risk management strategies.<br>

## 📊 Data

Unit of Analysis: Each row represents a loan application and contains all the information about that individual the time of origination. The only value that this doesn't apply to is the loan outcome which is our target variable.
