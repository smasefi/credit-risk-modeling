# ðŸ’³ Credit Risk Modeling<br>
## ðŸ“Œ Business Problem

Lending institutions must balance profitability with risk: approving enough loan applications to generate revenue, while minimizing losses from defaults.
The core question is:

This is important work because using these probabilities, we can better understand how to reduce credit losses by screening out high-risk borrowers, price loans effectively and manage risk (in terms of losses).<br>

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

Given borrower and loan information available at the time of application, the goal is to build a supervised machine learning model that estimates the probability of default.

This model will help inform approval/denial decisions and support better credit risk management strategies.<br>
